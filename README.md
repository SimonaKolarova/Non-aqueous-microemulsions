# Phase behaviour predictive modelling 

Development of a machine learning model for the reliable prediction of microemulsion formation in ternary nonaqueous systems stabilised by soybean phosphatidylcholine and comprising a variety of polar and non-polar solvents.

This work was carried out as a part of my PhD research into the formation and properties of nonaqeous microemulsions stabilised by soybean phosphatidylcholine and their applications as active ingredient delivery systems in toothpaste formulations. The research was supported by an EPSRC CASE award in partnership between King's College London and GSK Consumer Healthcare R&D.
